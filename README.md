# Jonny's Userscripts

This repository contains userscripts that I have written.

## What is a userscript?

[The Wikipedia definition:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript)
>A userscript (or user script) is a program, usually written in JavaScript, for modifying web pages to augment browsing. On desktop browsers such as Firefox, they are enabled by use of a userscript manager browser extension such as [Greasemonkey] or [Scriptish].

Basically, they modify the way websites work on the browser side, kind of like mini browser extensions that can add, change or remove (e.g. ads) certain functionality to webpages.

The userscript manager I currently use is [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/).
